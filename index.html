            <h1>About <span class="line-highlight"> Me</span></h1>
            <p>Cooking has been one of the greatest teachers in developing my character. It can be instantly rewarding — a grand celebration of flavor. Or it can turn quickly into a life lesson, keeping you humble with lots of opportunities to learn about loss, imperfection, acceptance, perseverance, grief, willingness and ultimately a simple forgiveness that leaves you with a choice to either throw in the dishtowel or try, try again.</p><br>
